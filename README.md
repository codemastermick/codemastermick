### Codemaster Mick

I build things, I make things work better and I fix things. I can bring the world's knowledge to the palm of your hand, or send your ideas scattering across the globe. I design systems and invent the math to support them if I need to. I think about how things work on a different level than other people, and am able to take things apart and understand them.

I am programmer. See me code.
